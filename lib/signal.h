// signal.h - handling an asynchronous signal.
//
// This header is the reason 'a function returning a function pointer' had to
// be implemented before it could be written. signal takes a handler and gives
// back the previous one, so its declaration is
//
//     void (*signal(int sig, void (*handler)(int)))(int);
//
// which reads outwards from the name: signal is a function, taking an int and
// a pointer to a function taking int and returning void, and returning a
// pointer to a function taking int and returning void. It is the standard
// library's most-quoted declaration and it is not a puzzle, it is just C's
// declarator grammar meaning what it says.
//
// SIGABRT is the one number here that moves: 6 on macOS and Linux, 22 under
// the UCRT. The other five agree on all three, which was measured rather than
// assumed.

// linkage name and ask the linker for a symbol libc has never had.
