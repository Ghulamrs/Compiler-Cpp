// merely big enough, because a program declares its own 'struct tm' and hands
// the address to mktime or strftime. Get it short and the library writes past
// the end of it.
//
// C90 defines nine members. The Unix platforms add two more after them -
// tm_gmtoff and tm_zone - and the UCRT adds none, which is exactly the 56
// against 36 bytes measured on the two kinds of platform. Both are declared
// below, so a struct tm here is the same object the platform's own header
// describes.
//
// The two extra members are named rather than reserved because a program that
// reads tm_zone after localtime is doing something reasonable, and hiding the
// field would only make it declare its own struct.
//
// clock_t is the other thing that moves: eight bytes on Linux and macOS, four
// under the UCRT - and CLOCKS_PER_SEC is a million on the first two and a
// thousand on the third. A program dividing by it gets seconds on all three;
// a program assuming microseconds gets them on two.
