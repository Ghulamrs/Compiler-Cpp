// locale.h - the conventions that vary by country.

// The LC_ numbers are the thing to be careful about here, because they are the
// one set in the standard library that the three platforms genuinely disagree
// about. Measured:
//
//                LC_ALL  LC_COLLATE  LC_CTYPE  LC_MONETARY  LC_NUMERIC  LC_TIME
//     macOS         0         1          2          3            4         5
//     Windows       0         1          2          3            4         5
//     glibc         6         3          0          4            1         2
//
// A program calling setlocale(LC_ALL, "") with the wrong number does not fail;
// it sets a different category and carries on, which is why this is guarded
// rather than picked.
//
// struct lconv is the other half, and it is a **read-only** structure: the
// program never declares one, it takes the pointer localeconv returns and
// reads through it. That is what makes it safe for this declaration to be
// shorter than the platform's own - the C90 members come first on all three,
// so their offsets are right, and the wide-character members the UCRT adds
// after them are simply not described here. A struct tm could not be treated
// this way, because a program allocates one of those.
