// Member functions and `this` - the second step of rung 3, and the step where
// "inside the class" starts to exist.
//
// A member function is a free function with one extra leading pointer, which
// is why the backends needed nothing: `this` is parameter zero and every
// backend already knew how to pass a pointer. What is new is the name - both
// ABIs spell the class into it, and the Microsoft one spells the access in as
// well, so a private member has a different symbol there and the same symbol
// on Linux. Every one of those was measured against clang.
//
// Uses::viaPrivate is the point of the whole step: a private member is
// reachable from another member of the same class and from nowhere else.
