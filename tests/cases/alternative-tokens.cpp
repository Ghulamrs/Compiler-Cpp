// The eleven word-spelled alternative tokens of [lex.digraph] table 2.
//
// **They are keywords in C++, not the macros <iso646.h> makes of them in C**,
// and [lex.digraph]/2 says each behaves in every respect as the operator it
// spells, spelling apart. So the whole feature is a rewrite in the lexer: a
// word that is one of the eleven becomes its primary token there, and no rule
// downstream - expression, declarator, destructor name, `operator` name -
// needs to have heard of it.
//
// That is why this case reaches past expressions. `bitand` is `&`, so it is a
// reference declarator and an address-of as well as a bitwise and; `compl` is
// `~`, so it names a destructor. Neither is a special case in the parser and
// neither would work if the eleven had been given rules of their own.
//
// Nine of the eleven used to be refused with `expected ';'` or `expected ')'`
// - a message naming no feature, which `tools/exclusions` cannot list and so
// nobody could see was missing. `not` and `compl` were refused by name because
// they can begin an expression, which is the only reason those two were
// visible at all.
//
// Two shapes here are for names.sh and not for the feature. `S`'s constructor
// and destructor are defined out of line, because clang emits only the C2
// variant of one written inline; and the block holding the `S` calls printf
// after it, because a scope whose only cleanup can never be reached needs no
// landing pad, and clang drops the one cxx1 keeps. Neither is about the
// alternative tokens, and removing either turns this case red for a reason
// that is not.
//
// The preprocessor gets them too, and separately: `#if 1 and 1` is a
// conditional-expression in the same grammar, and that evaluator works on text
// rather than on the lexer's tokens. It rewrites the words after macro
// expansion, because a macro *body* may spell one where a macro *name* may
// not.
