// **`mutable` on a data member**, which [dcl.stc]/9 makes writable through a
// const object - the keyword a class reaches for when something it caches or
// counts is not part of the value it presents. Five of Compiler++'s sixteen
// sources were stopped by one `mutable bool` in one header.
//
// What it took was three lines, because the propagation was already in one
// shape at each of the three places a member is reached: `.`, `->`, and the
// implicit `this->name` inside a member function each ask whether the object
// is const and qualify the member's type if it is. A mutable member is the
// second exception there, beside the reference member that was already
// exempt - and it is a property of the member rather than of its type, which
// is why the flag sits on `Member` and not in the qualifiers.
