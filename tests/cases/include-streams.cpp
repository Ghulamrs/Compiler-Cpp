// The stream headers this compiler ships: <iostream>, <sstream>, <fstream>.
//
// **The oracle here is behavioural and not textual**, as it is for the other
// include cases: the suite hands this file to clang as well, and clang reads
// *its* <iostream>, not this one. So the two libraries are compared through
// what the same program prints - which is a far better question than reading
// the header and believing it.
//
// **`std::cout` is an object at file scope with no constructor**, and that is
// the whole trick these headers turn. A constructor there would have to run
// before `main`, which this compiler refuses because there is nowhere yet to
// put the code that would do it - so `ostream` is an aggregate, `cout` is a
// constant initialiser, and the `FILE *` is resolved at the point of use. An
// `ofstream` *does* have a constructor, and that is not an inconsistency: it
// is always a local, and a local with a constructor has always worked.
//
// A stringstream reuses every operator of its base rather than repeating them,
// through one pointer in `ostream` that says "write to this string instead".
// A virtual would have been the other way to do it, and a virtual is what
// `cout` cannot have - it would need a vptr, and a vptr needs a constructor.
//
// One compiler fault had to land before this case could be written: **a
// reference to a base would not bind to a derived object**, so
// `std::getline(istringstream, s)` found no matching function. The pointer
// form had always worked; the reference form was never done, and the fix
// ranks it as the derived-to-base conversion it is.
