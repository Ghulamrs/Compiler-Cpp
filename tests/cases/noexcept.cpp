// noexcept, both of them: the specifier and the operator.
//
// **In C++11 the exception specification is not part of the function's type.**
// Measured: `void f() noexcept` and `void f()` both mangle to `_Z1fv` on
// Itanium and `?f@@YAXXZ` on Microsoft. So no name, no signature match and no
// overload set changes - which is most of why this rung is small. C++17 made
// it part of the type; this compiler targets C++11.
//
// What the specifier buys is a compile-time answer, and the operator is what
// asks for it. `noexcept(e)` does not run `e`: it is parsed for its meaning
// and thrown away, the way `sizeof`'s operand is, and what is kept is whether
// anything in it could throw. That is counted *during* the parse rather than
// by walking the tree afterwards, because every call already passes through
// one place and so does every `throw`.
//
// **The promise is not enforced at run time** - a throw escaping a `noexcept`
// function propagates here where it should call std::terminate. That is
// recorded in docs/CONFORMANCE.md rather than half-built.
